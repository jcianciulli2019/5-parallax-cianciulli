  <p>It has been an honor to see 5 sports championships from the time I was nine years old. I only need one more team to get the job done.</p>

  <p>When I was little I wasn't that too much into sports, I tried out many in my life and I just didn't enjoy what I was doing.  then took a little break from sports until I saw my parents watching a game one time, I was immediatly hooked and enjoyed it, I thought, Wow, this is something that I can enjoy, and nine years later, I still do.</p>

  <p>In the near future I hope to be involved in sports as a career choice, wether it is working for an actual team, or it's working for a network's coverage of an event, wether it is in the booth or if it's in the studio. I am looking into majoring in sports managment in college.</p>
